on point: khw, rjbs
topic: khw has encountered a gnarly backrefs bug and it's blocking him
agenda:
  - the theory is that nobody is going to help much until after holidays
  - karl is going to work on some other things for a while
  - if nobody has great ideas when he's done with those, he will use a
    workaround
  - ...but we should try to fix / address the underlying issue
