topic: update perlpolicy to reflect reality, and reality to reflect perlpolicy

- http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2014/06/msg216280.html
- specific points to clear up:
  - when is lexical scope (a la 'feature') required?
  - when do we break backcompat (since "serious harm" is bogus)
    - can we remove things just because they're stupid?
  - why can we deprecate things?
  - what about new warnings?
  - how does this apply to the XS API?
