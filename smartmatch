on point: rjbs, doy

questions:
  - can we really make ~~ pluggable?  "the dynamic scope question"
  - should we just deprecate it entirely?
  - interaction's with chip's SV work

notes:
  - talked with doy 2011-11-07, expect an email within week
  - current feelings: ~~ can't be safely lexicalized
