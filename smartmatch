on point: rjbs, doy

questions:
  - can we really make ~~ pluggable?  "the dynamic scope question"
  - should we just deprecate it entirely?
  - interaction's with chip's SV work
  - can we possibly deal with num/str?  worried about chips work being "the
    unicode bug" again

notes:
  - talked with doy 2011-11-07, expect an email within week
  - current feelings: ~~ can't be safely lexicalized
  - talked with Damian Conway at OSCON; was productive
  - should post the results of our discussion soon -- rjbs, 2012-08-09
  - posted the results today -- rjbs, 2012-08-16
