- v-string versions are insane
- why do we remember and enshrine the original literal form of vstr?
- why isn't a version comparison just $v1 cmp $v2?
- if we make it make sense, what breaks?

- had a long talk with ether/haarg/ribasushi/xdg/leont at QAH
  hopefully notes published in the next month
- leon wrote a branch
- emailed p5p and jpeacock with suggestion and notes on leon's work
