summary:
- given now creates a dynamic, not lexical $_
- ... so do we want to keep having my $_?  it's almost always wrong
- ... but less "always" when the user had to type "my $_"
- ... but some report that new users head toward that because of
      the suggestion that "my" is always right with variables
- do we get a technical win out of removing it?
