  Subject: [perl #119317] [EXPERIMENT] smartmatch and given/when
  Message-ID: <rt-3.6.HEAD-2552-1376808059-702.119317-15-0@perl.org>

- https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=119317

questions:
  - can we really make ~~ pluggable?  "the dynamic scope question"
  - should we just deprecate it entirely?
  - interaction's with chip's SV work
  - can we possibly deal with num/str?  worried about chips work being "the
    unicode bug" again

notes:
  - talked with doy 2011-11-07, expect an email within week
  - current feelings: ~~ can't be safely lexicalized
  - talked with Damian Conway at OSCON; was productive
  - should post the results of our discussion soon -- rjbs, 2012-08-09
  - posted the results today -- rjbs, 2012-08-16
  - posted update asking for exp. warning on the feature -- rjbs, 2013-02-25
  - discussion tentatively restarted by creation of [#119317]; sprout re-posed
    quesitons; must answer after vacation -- rjbs, 2013-08-18
