my %pairs = %hash{ qw(a b c) };

- emailed ruz to ask for update -- rjbs, 2013-08-01
- the update, in part:

  Functionality is ready as I like it, but we had dispute regarding behavior
  in left value functions. I started mail on why I think forbidding key/value
  hash slices as result of lvalue subs is good and right thing to do, but it
  sits in drafts.

  they need:
  * documentation in the core, summary I wrote and posted should be split and
    placed into perl's pod files
  * tests should be cloned and converted to test for index/value array
    slices. I suspect bugs in this part.
  * more corner case tests is always good

- ruz got some info from sprout about how to distinguish two contexts they
  wanted to be able to distinguish -- rjbs, 2013-08-25
