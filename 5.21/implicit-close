    Subject: Re: perl needs safer implicit close

This is one of the things I would most like to see addressed in the next stable
release of perl.  We've got a five year old ticket about it.  I will decline to
speculate what that says about it getting done:

  https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=57512

Tom's description there is, to nobody's surprise, thorough and on point.

Basically:  autovivified filehandles in lexical variables feel a *lot* easier
to use, and avoid package variables, which we try to discourage elsewhere for
various reasons.  The problem is that the list of reasons to use them sometimes
includes, "and you don't have to account for closing them, because they close
when the reference is destroyed!"  Yeah, they close, and the error status is
lost forever, like tears in rain.

We should issue a warning when an implicit close results in error.  autodie.pm
can then fatalize that warning.  We should also fatalize errors on the implicit
close of the selected fh at END, to deal with errors during -i, for example.
