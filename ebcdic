summary: ebcdic is probably broken; IBM was approached, but did not offer
  resources; discussed this extensively, esp. with Nicholas Clark

updates:
- john goodyear and khw are working on getting stuff going

agenda:
* âœ“ put out for help far and wide
* before 5.18.0: obnoxious warning notice in for EBCDIC in Configure
  (require -DSAW_EBCDIC_WARNING?); made a task
* before 5.18.0: put notice in perl5180delta about EBCDIC's future,
  publish ebcdic policy
* IF EBCDIC NOT REPAIRED:
  * before 5.19.0: make Configure refuse
  * after  5.19.september: fair game on removing code branches
