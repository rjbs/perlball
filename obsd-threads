  10:34 >@Nicholas< rjbs: "someone" probably should ask Steven Schubiger what's 
                  up with OpenBSD 5 and threads. And whether his MirBSD ever 
                  worked
  10:34 <@Nicholas> and "someone" doesn't need to be Nicholas or rjbs
  10:35 <@rjbs> I didn't know anything was up!  I'll make a note.
  10:35 <@Nicholas> it's sending smoke reports to perl5-porters
  10:35 <@rjbs> Okay, must've not gotten to those yet.
  10:35 <@Nicholas> which say FAIL
  10:35 <@Nicholas> and they FAIL with a vertical column of Ms
  10:36 <@rjbs> trying to review smokes in categorized batches
  10:36 <@Nicholas> patterns of Ms usually mean something systematic
