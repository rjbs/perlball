summary: do not forget whether an SV was originally str/num when coercing

questions:
  - how much do we want to advertise that this was done and has value for
    end-users
  - Aristotle warned that this could be "the unicode bug" again if people
    think that the type data is reliable when it is only /often/ reliable
  - does it solve the problems promised?  (What are they?)
