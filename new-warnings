- what's the deal with adding new non-default warnings
- lots of changes/discussion
- tentatively plan: "use warnings;" now means "use warnings 'default'"
- and "no warnings;" should mean "no warnings 'all';"
  ...because when you say "no more sandwiches" you don't just mean the ones
  on the normal menu, you mean the custom ones you asked for too
- can we apply this to strictures as well?
